# MONITORING-FOR-TRANSACTIONAL-EMAILS

Transactional emails are automated, realtime messages that are sent to users through email after a specific action has been performed on a website or application. These emails are often used for a wide range of alerts such as account creation, password resets, order confirmations, invoices, shipping notifications and more.
